NORTH GEORGIA - This blog was created in an attempt to learn how to use Jekyll and RubyGem on Codecademy. There is no telling how long it will continue or if it will even continue. I may also use this as a way to test different effects of changing the code.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight lua %}
print("Test")
pie=3.14
if pie<4 then
  print("Yes")
end
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

            <p>I'm a student at the University of Georgia majoring in Computer Science. I started programming in 5th grade as a game developer in ROBLOX. My first programming language was a modified version of Lua, and I tried to make different games to challenge my ability to code. It was always exciting when I could run a game and everything worked as I intended. I eventually left the game development and programming community and thought about studying to be an Aerospace Engineer. I took a few dual enrollment courses including Calculus 2 and Principles of Physics and had an unexpected awakening of what lied ahead. Once I started college, I took my first Computer Science class and realized that, although different than when I first started, I still liked programming and I still had the same excitement that I did before. </p>
            <p>While I enjoy learning programming languages like Python and Java, I also studied Spanish for 6 years and Italian for 3 years and love practicing to retain my knowledge. I practice Spanish daily at Chick-fil-A when I talk with my Hispanic co-workers or take orders for people that may struggle with English. After Spanish, I had always wanted to learn Italian because I have Italian ancestors, so I took the opportunity to learn it at UGA. I got the chance to test my knowledge when my family and I traveled to Italy as a high-school graduation trip. It was an amazing experience, not only to see different parts of Italy but to be able to travel and communicate without depending on English. </p>
            <p>The most recent hobby I've taken on is golf. My fiancee played competitively for many years, so I thought I would learn to play with her and her family. It was frustrating trying to get the motions down but once I started to get the hang of it, golf turned out to be a fun weekend activity. </p>
